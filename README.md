# BRUTER

*`UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT`*

# Concept

  BRUTER does not have types, everything is a sequence of 4 or 8 bytes, depending on the system;

  BRUTER does not keep a track of what the user meant to each variable, it just stores the data, it is up to the user to keep track of what is what if needed;
